I2C_OLED_Rasberry_Pi
====================

Library for wide.hk 0.96" I2C display in python.

and i've used the fonts provided by KaR]V[aN, in his "GPS Toy / On board computer" project:

Please, all the credits, goes to the respective authors, i am simply porting the examples to python, to be able to use them in my raspberry.

Thank you very much.
